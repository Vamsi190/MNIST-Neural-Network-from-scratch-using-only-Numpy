# MNIST-Neural-Network-from-scratch-using-only-Numpy
This a two layered Neural Network created using math and use of `numpy` as a package

The two layered neural network consits of the following:
- `Input layer` or the 0th layer
- `Hidden layer` or the first layer
- `Output layer` - Y.

The objective of this Neural network is to train it on a handwritten grayscale digit images 
for the network to be able to recognise and predict it correctly.

The MNSIT dataset was used to train the Neural Network.
